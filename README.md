This is a project I made for myself to view a summary of my emails, some cool pictures of people's computer setups and some interesting news from webdev community.

Using reddit's own .json API, I am fetching top 3 r/webdev posts of the day, and top workstation pictures for inspiration. You can change these by simply editing the js code in the partials/foot.html.

For example, you can change "battlestations" and "workstations" parts with any subreddit name that posts images, and you'll see those at the top. You can also change r/webdev with any other subreddit.
